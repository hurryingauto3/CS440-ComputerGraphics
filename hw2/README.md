# Homework II - Foundations II
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2020

## Purpose

Our eventual display medium is an image which comprises of pixels, each represented by a color value. Line and polygon drawing are fundamental operations and are the natuiral next step after pixel manipulation in the previous assignment. We will also explore how discrete elements like lines and polygons are used to represent seemingly smooth objects, e.g. a circle. 

We also like to render pretty pictures, especially if they have elegant mathematical descriptions.

In all of this, we want to develop sophisticated insight into these operations which befits our status as curious, investigative CS seniors. This inevitably means playing with the underlying math.

## Background

For this assignment, you should
- understand the composition of an image
- be comfortable with the `MyImage` class used in HW I
- be able to perform arithmetic and vector operations
- be able to think algorithmically
- have an appreciation for the application of math 
- have an appreciation of programming as a tool to efficiently carry out interesting mathematical operations at scale
- be familiar with operations on complex numbers
- be comfortable with reading, writing, testing, and debugging code in python, especially involving recursion

## The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw2.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

## Grading

Grading will be as per the criteria specified in the accompanying review file, _hw2-review.xlsx_.

## Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment.

### 2.1 Solving the Problem Set

You will use the provided file `myimage.py` in functions spread over 2 different files, `api.py` and `application.py`. Each questions in the problem set identifies the name of the function to write for it and the file to which it must be added. Please make sure your submitted functions have the indicated names and are in the indicated files otherwise they will be difficult to find and grade. The files `api.py` and `application.py` in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your submission. As your submission will be graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

Deadline: 18h on Friday, 25 September

### 2.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your teammate and on the assignment. The related assignment will be available on LMS with further instructions.

Deadline: 18h on Monday, 28 September

### 2.3 Peer Review

You will review and grade 2 submissions which will be shared with you. The related assignment will be available on LMS with further instructions.

Deadline: 18h on Monday, 28 September

## Discussion

Please use the following avenues:

- discuss with your teammate,
- the discussion forum on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- talk to course staff.
